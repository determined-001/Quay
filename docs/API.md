# HTTP API

The API is served by `@checkout/api` (Hono) on `http://localhost:8787` by default
(`API_PORT`). All request and response bodies are JSON.

> **Auth:** `POST /auth` (below) issues a session JWT after a wallet-signed SEP-10
> challenge, and a seller row is created for the wallet on first login. `/links`
> and `/webhooks` do not check this token yet and still operate on the single
> demo seller — scoping them by authenticated seller is tracked separately. This
> is fine for local development and demos, not for production. See the README's
> "Before you go live" section.

CORS is restricted to the origins in `CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated).

## Conventions

- Money amounts are decimal strings (e.g. `"10.50"`), validated to at most 7
  decimals. Internally compared in integer stroops, never floats.
- Errors return `{ "error": "<code>", ... }` with an appropriate HTTP status.
  Validation failures return `400` with `{ "error": "invalid_body", "issues": [...] }`.

## `GET /health`

Liveness + basic config echo.

**200**
```json
{ "ok": true, "network": "testnet", "sellerWallet": "G..." }
```

---

## `GET /auth?account=G...`

Step 1 of [SEP-10](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md)
wallet login: builds a challenge transaction for the given account to sign.

**200**
```json
{ "transaction": "AAAAAgAAAAA...", "network_passphrase": "Test SDF Network ; September 2015" }
```
**400** — `{ "error": "missing_account" }` or `{ "error": "account must be a valid Stellar G-address" }`

---

## `POST /auth`

Step 2: submit the challenge transaction signed by the account's wallet(s).
Verifies the server's own signature, timebounds, domain fields, and that
signature weight from the account's actual signers (via Horizon, M-of-N aware)
meets its medium threshold — the account's master key if it isn't funded yet.
Each challenge can be redeemed exactly once.

On success, a seller row is created for the wallet if one doesn't exist yet
(the wallet address **is** the identity).

**Request**
```json
{ "transaction": "AAAAAgAAAAA..." }
```

**200**
```json
{ "token": "<session JWT>" }
```
**401** — `{ "error": "<reason>" }`, e.g. signature verification failed, challenge
already used, or the transaction doesn't match what we issued.

---

## `GET /.well-known/stellar.toml`

[SEP-1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md)
descriptor advertising `SIGNING_KEY`, `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT`, and `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`
so wallets can discover this service's SEP-10 endpoint — the server-side mirror of
how `packages/offramp/src/sep10.ts` discovers anchors.

---

## `POST /links`

Create a payment link.

**Request**
```json
{
  "title": "T-shirt",
  "amount": "10.50",
  "assetCode": "USDC",
  "expiresInMinutes": 60
}
```
- `title` — required, 1–120 chars.
- `amount` — required, positive, ≤ 7 decimals.
- `assetCode` — `"USDC"` (default) or `"XLM"`. The USDC issuer is resolved
  server-side from config.
- `expiresInMinutes` — optional positive integer (≤ 43200). Omit for no expiry.

**201**
```json
{
  "link": {
    "id": "lnk_...",
    "reference": "...",
    "status": "pending",
    "title": "T-shirt",
    "amount": "10.50",
    "asset": { "code": "USDC", "issuer": "G..." },
    "destination": "G...",
    "expiresAt": 1750000000000
  },
  "request": {
    "uri": "web+stellar:pay?destination=...&amount=...&memo=...",
    "memo": "...",
    "memoType": "text"
  }
}
```
The `request.uri` is a spec-correct SEP-7 payment URI for the buyer's wallet/QR.
The buyer **must** pay with the given `memo` — that is how the watcher correlates
the on-chain payment back to this link.

---

## `GET /links`

List the seller's links.

**200**
```json
{ "links": [ { "id": "lnk_...", "status": "paid", "...": "..." } ] }
```

---

## `GET /links/:id`

Fetch one link plus its payment request (used by the checkout page).

**200** — same shape as the `POST /links` response.
**404** — `{ "error": "not_found" }`

---

## `POST /links/:id/cash-out`

Seller-initiated off-ramp of a **paid** link to local currency. Runs
`quote → initiate` against the off-ramp adapter and moves the link to
`offramp_pending`; a background poller advances it to `offramp_settled` /
`offramp_failed`.

> The default adapter is `MockAnchorOffRamp` — it simulates an FX quote and payout
> and **moves no money**.

**Request**
```json
{
  "targetCurrency": "NGN",
  "payoutFields": { "bank": "...", "accountNumber": "..." }
}
```
- `targetCurrency` — 3-letter code, defaults to `NGN`.
- `payoutFields` — opaque string map handed to the anchor adapter.

**200**
```json
{
  "job": {
    "jobId": "ofr_...",
    "linkId": "lnk_...",
    "status": "pending",
    "targetCurrency": "NGN",
    "targetAmount": "17325.00",
    "rate": "1650"
  }
}
```
**409** — link is not in `paid` state: `{ "error": "Link must be paid to cash out (is \"pending\")" }`
**404** — `{ "error": "Link not found" }`
**403** — `{ "error": "kyc_required" }`. Only possible with `OFFRAMP=testanchor`: the
seller's SEP-12 KYC (see below) hasn't reached `ACCEPTED` yet. `payoutFields` is
bank/routing info only — it is never used as a source of identity data.

---

## `GET /seller/kyc`

Current SEP-12 requirements and status for the seller, re-synced from the anchor
(`OFFRAMP=mock` always reports `ACCEPTED` — there's no real anchor to satisfy).

**200**
```json
{
  "status": "NEEDS_INFO",
  "requiredFields": [
    { "name": "first_name", "type": "string", "optional": false },
    { "name": "email_address", "type": "string", "optional": false }
  ],
  "providedFields": { "first_name": "Ada" },
  "message": null,
  "lastSyncedAt": 1750000000000
}
```
`status` is one of `unsubmitted | NEEDS_INFO | PROCESSING | ACCEPTED | REJECTED`.

---

## `PUT /seller/kyc`

Submit or update identity fields. Values are sent to the anchor **exactly as
given** — no field is ever defaulted or fabricated. Call with `{}` to kick off
discovery before any fields are known.

**Request**
```json
{ "first_name": "Ada", "email_address": "ada@example.org" }
```

**200** — same shape as `GET /seller/kyc`, reflecting the anchor's response
(which may reveal further required fields — SEP-12 discovery is progressive).

**422**
```json
{ "error": "kyc_required", "missingFields": ["email_address"] }
```
Returned when a field the anchor is already known to require is missing —
naming exactly which ones, never silently substituting a placeholder.

---

## `POST /webhooks`

Register a webhook endpoint. The signing secret is returned **once** — store it.

**Request**
```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/hooks/checkout" }
```

**201**
```json
{ "id": "...", "url": "https://example.com/hooks/checkout", "secret": "<hex>" }
```

---

## `GET /webhooks`

List registered webhooks. Secrets are **not** returned.

**200**
```json
{ "webhooks": [ { "id": "...", "url": "...", "createdAt": 1750000000000 } ] }
```

---

## Webhook delivery

When a link changes state, the API POSTs a JSON event to each registered URL:

| Event             | Fired when                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `link.paid`       | a matching payment settled (exact or over)  |
| `link.underpaid`  | a payment arrived for less than requested   |
| `offramp.settled` | a cash-out job settled                       |
| `offramp.failed`  | a cash-out job failed                        |

**Body**
```json
{
  "event": "link.paid",
  "data": {
    "linkId": "lnk_...",
    "reference": "...",
    "status": "paid",
    "amount": "10.50",
    "paidAmount": "10.50",
    "asset": { "code": "USDC", "issuer": "G..." },
    "txHash": "...",
    "overpaid": false
  },
  "id": "lnk_...",
  "sentAt": "2026-06-19T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Headers**
- `x-checkout-event` — the event name.
- `x-checkout-signature` — `sha256=<hex>`, an HMAC-SHA256 of the **exact raw body**
  using your webhook secret.

Delivery is retried with exponential backoff (default 4 attempts) on transient
failures — network errors and `5xx`/`429` responses. A `4xx` (other than `429`) is
treated as permanent and not retried. Return `2xx` quickly to acknowledge receipt.

For **replay protection**, reject events whose in-body `sentAt` is older than a
small window (e.g. 5 minutes). `sentAt` is part of the signed body, so it cannot be
forged without the secret.

**Verifying** (recompute over the raw body and compare in constant time):

```js
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";

function verify(rawBody, header, secret) {
  const expected = "sha256=" + createHmac("sha256", secret).update(rawBody).digest("hex");
  const a = Buffer.from(header);
  const b = Buffer.from(expected);
  return a.length === b.length && timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}
```
